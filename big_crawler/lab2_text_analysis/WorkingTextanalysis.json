faster than by a computer capable of one petaflop which would need one year for the task This adds a whole new dimension to the fight against climate change” Sterling says The Sunway is followed by the Tianhe2 which still has almost twice as much computing power as the Piz Daint from Switzerland which comes third The fastest US computer Titan is fifth 01Focus – Age of the super brainsDevelopment

artificial intelligence AI Professor Klaus Mainzer Out of the many possible combinations of these building blocks they help to single out those that offer the prospect of surprising discoveries and new products The supercomputer is capable of learning and it performs an initial selection so that only the most promising substances find their way into the laboratory Accordingly BASF has since fall 2017 relied on just such a powerful digital helper for developing virtual experiments and answering complex questions It shortens the time taken to obtain usable results from several months to a few days see pages 24–25“The challenging problems in the field of chemistry could become drivers for supercomputing” Sterling believes In his view they could contribute to investigating the critical boundaries of technology – and how to overcome them The bottlenecks between processors and memory pose increasing problems to the industry These become more serious as the masses of data which have to be shifted around in simulations for example grow larger “This bottleneck in traditional von Neumann computerarchitecture needs to be eliminated” Sterling says A new way of thinking is required to bring together computing and memory operations in a smart way Another technology has already assimilated the elementary logic by which chemical processes work the quantum computer which could open up new horizons of knowledge The next dimension of super brains – thinking in several states at once – is in the starting blocks\f14 – Creating ChemistryPhoto dwave systemsSuch processors are intended to make quantum computers the most powerful type availableQuantum computersA shiny silver cylinder holds the treasure qubits frozen by a helium pump to minus 273 degrees Celsius These are the building blocks that enable quantum computers to work because unlike the bits in a classical computer qubits can store and process two states simultaneously This new computer logic is intended to make them much faster than any supercomputer and their search for new products applications or patterns more efficient The disadvantage is that qubits are extremely volatile They function in a stable faultfree manner only if there are no external influences To ensure this they have to be not merely frozen but also shielded from the outside world in a vacuumFragile super brainsEfforts to crack this problem are still in the initial stages To date researchers have developed fully programmable fivequbit computers and more fragile 10 to 20qubit test systems For example in May 2017 IBM presented a processor with 17 qubits which is intended to form the foundation of the first commercially available quantum computer “We’re progressing faster and faster” says IBM researcher AnthonyAnnunziata PhD from the United States Now he notes the IBM system is stable enough to perform computing operations over a fairly longperiod But Annunziata warns that the technology is still at a very early stage “Quantum computers are more or less at the same stage as classicalcomputers were in the 1940s but they are developing even more rapidly than classical computers did back then” he saysIt is only when we reach around 30 to 50qubits that a quantum computer would be superior to any conventional supercomputer in solving a specific problem in the view of experts such as Professor Raymond Laflamme Director of the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo in Canada “But if we extrapolate the trend of the last 15 years 100 qubits are conceivable within the next 10 years” says the pioneer in quantum computing The Massachusetts Institute of Technology predicts that a fundamental breakthrough for quantum computers could well be made within four to five years 02“Quantum computers are more

developers at NASA and Google for example are usingWhether it is IBM Google Microsoft or Intel none of the big tech companies is afraid of the high cost involved in developing a powerful quantum computer – to say nothing of secret services like the US NSA which are probably working “under the radar” on powerful quantum systems to crack encrypted communicationsQuantum computers bring impetusThis is because Moore’s Law according to which the power of computer chips will double every one to two years is now getting close to its technological limits Experts believe that a breakthrough in quantum computers could provide a fresh impetus According to Laflamme six to seven teams worldwide are currently engaged in research to achieve this goal and billions arebeing spent in the process For example theEuropean Commission is planning to invest €1 billion in driving progress in quantum technology over the next nine years Also China made headlines in August 2017 with the

uniqueHow they work Special building blocks qubits enable quantum computers to process data very quickly and simultaneouslyWhat a qubit is A qubit is an information unit in quantum mechanics Whereas the bits of classical computers work in a state of 1 or 0 a qubit can simultaneously assume both values –or an infinite number of inter mediate states If it werepossible to bundle hundreds of these

zero – plus total darkness and silenceThe heart of the quantum computer The qubits inthe processor atthe bottom ofthe quantumcomputer provideitsenormouscomputing powertime – a milestone on the road to virtually unhackable encryption through quantum technologyHowever “for the foreseeable future quantum computers won’t surpass or even substitute supercomputers across the board” Annunziata says “They will act as a supplement for the solution of very special problems” They are ideally suited to represent dynamics in molecules and thus to show for example how one electron interacts with another and with the nucleus “If the number of electronic states increases the number of possible interactions increases exponentially Asconventional computers can’t represent that properly they try with approximations” he says A quantum computer meanwhile is already using quantum mechanics the kind of mechanisms that are also at work in molecular interactionsBenefits for researchSeveral sectors can benefit from the greater precision of modeling such as materials sciences and the chemical or pharmaceutical industries Laflamme says Researchers can use the disadvantage of quantum particles – their sensitivity – to their advantage here for example in prospecting for natural resources or diagnosing illnesses For instance qubits are already being deployed as supersensitive sensors that can precisely detect individual atoms of defective proteins that might turn cancerous To do this they focus very closely on the vibrations of one specific atomCurrently though the main priority is to increase the number of people who want to understand and use quantum computers Annunziata says This is why IBM made its quantum computer accessible to the public about a year ago Since then 50000 users have accessed the QuantumExperience platform Through the open sourceapproach it is possible to learn from and with the community Annunziata says According to media reports Google’s parent company Alphabet has recently followed suit with its quantum computer and is planning to open it to academics and developers This may result in the emergence of a kind of ecosystem in which the

gives the orders and the artificial intelligence systems learnThe human factor – Four theses on the new relationship between humans and algorithms1Algorithms are only humantoo The deceptive semblance of objectivityData are being analyzed by software in more and more areas of life Such algorithms are gaining in power as a result However they are as subjective and selective as their programming by their human “creators” Algorithms incorporate the conscious or unconscious prejudices and life experiences of their programmers Loans are refused or made hard to obtain because the software places the borrower in a problematicneighborhood even though the person is perfectly solvent Seemingly objective software to predict crime “predictive policing” can serve to reinforce existing discrimination If it leads police to perform a particularly high number of checks in socially deprived areas they will possibly record more crime there This will then be more stronglyweighted in digitized forecasts2The world is a story to be told – not a thing to be countedTrue value creation results from a combination of data analysis and human expertise As early as 2008 Chris Anderson announced the “end of theory” “The data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete” wrote the editor of Wired magazine He believed that thanks to big data algorithms could find patterns that research and science would never discover with their own methods “With enough data the numbers speak for themselves” Anderson said However some ten years after Anderson’s article that euphoria has been replaced by a more sober assessment This is attributable to failures by data collectors like Google whose Flu Trends program in 20122013 saw a flu epidemic on the march that never actually materialized In complex situations correlations cannot take the place of causality or assumptions the place of evidence Human expertise is required here3Computers propose humans dispose We have to maintain control over technologyArtificial intelligence AI systems are already developing independently Using mathematical logic they are learning from their mistakes and making their own decisions It is barely possible for humans to grasp exactly how the neural networks of AI reach their conclusions in every case This is an area with an urgent need for improvement says informatics professor Alan Bundy from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland Meanwhile politicians and consumerrights activists are demanding recognizedstandards for AI algorithms as they grow smarter They also want their workings to be

humans can assist them – or take back complete control4Supercomputers are not automatically better than humans Human experience and values cannot be replicatedMachines are making rapid progress in learning thanks to AI and machine­ learning algorithms Researchers regard super­ intelligence – machines superior to humans in many or all areas – as possible within a few decades This requires a rational look at the limits and scope of new technologies In specific areas artificial intelligence can use solid data as the basis to make objectively better decisions than humans who often act intuitively However in complex decisions that go to the heart of the way that humans live together such as the fight against pov­erty there is no right or a wrong answer Behind such decisions there are humans making choices according to their respective experience values and goals This essence of a humane democratic society cannot be delegated to smart machinesPro Artificial intelligence AI systems are already capable of doing things that we achieve through learning experiences and intuition They do this just with great computing power and sophisticatedmathematics It is without doubt a significant innovation and we should make use of it Artificial intelligence can beat any poker expert without emo­tion or consciousness even though the game is regarded as a byword for intuition Moreover poker is merely a prototype for situations in which humans have to make decisions with incomplete infor­mation Sooner or later these algorithms will also be used in decision­making situations in business and politics For example they could support us but not take our place in complex contracts Thanks to big data it is now possible to identify the opinions of specific groups very precisely Techno­logically through AI something like a government by “perfect populism” is imaginable Some authors even believe democracy is endangered by highly intelligent algorithms This debate could be dismissed as science fiction I take it seri­ously Therefore we must take care to ensure that AI systems remain our servantsContra We are still extremely far from seeing intelligent machines take over the world If a Google computer is better than a human at mastering a very complex game there will be awestruck comments “Oh these machines are smarter than us” But a program of that sort can actually only do that one thing Even AI systems used in autonomous driving still have a very limited focus The artificial intelligence won’t be saying to itself “Um the way I’m acting right now might not be particularly safe” Humans however can take a step back and look at things from a broader perspective The real danger isn’t technol­ogy becoming too smart but comes from overrating stupid machines from entrusting them with tasks that overstrain them For instance when doc­tors rely too heavily on AI in their diagnoses But these are threats to individual people not to humanity as a wholeCreating

FocusCreating Chemistry Artificialintelligence seems to be everywhere today but what exactly is itProfessor Barbara Grosz They say that if you ask six researchers todefine AI you will get seven differentdefinitions so I’ll give you mine Artificial intelligence is both a field of study and a set of computational methods As a field of study the focus is on what I would call a computational understanding ofintelligent behavior By a computational understanding I mean determining the kinds of cognitive processes and representations that are needed to produce intelligent behavior thendetermining how to realize those in a computer system The set ofcomputational methods are then the algorithms even the mathematics but also the computational structures that you need to actually operationalize that understandingCreating computer systems that can communicate freely with people is akey challenge in artificial intelligence How has your work on naturallanguage processing aided in the pursuit ofthis goal When I started there were a lot of people working on syntactic processingmeaning the structure of sentences and semantic processing which is how meaning is built Everybody knew in some sense that context dialogue and pragmatics mattered but they had no idea how to handle these factorscomputationallySo one of the first things I did werewhat were later known as “Wizard of Oz” experiments I put two people in two different rooms communicating withteletype machines I told one of themthat they were talking with a computer and I asked them to complete a taskThe transcripts generated in thoseexperiments revealed that these kinds of “taskoriented dialogues” have a structure that the structure parallels the task and that the way in which we talk is affected by that structure Once I’ddeveloped a computational model of these taskoriented dialogues the next question was how you generalize from those to other types of conversation That led me with colleagues to the development of intentional models and to speechact theory which other people in AI have picked up onWhat happens when there are multiple agents communicating with each otherIn a dialogue you can’t assume that every participant understands everything about the other participants’ knowledge or intentions When you have multiple participants working together you have to model not only their individual plans but also the way participants interact and the way their plans are interwoven One thread of my work has been thedevelopment of those models Another has been to use the theoretical models as inspiration for design or as constraints on what parts of systems you have to buildAn example is a project I’m working Artificial intelligencewill support peoplenot replace themInterview

Those children may see upwards of 12 or 15 care providers who may have little detailed knowledge about each other’s work Today’s electronic health record systems do nothing to help these providers coordinate care delivery We are using our multiagent systems theory of collaboration as an analytic lens to see what is going on when careproviders and patients or in this case parents try to work together to see where the missing pieces are and understand what systems we can design that would help them work more effectively as a team One of those pieces is something that ensures all participants can see what the goals are so they know what they more layers That’s made an enormous difference in a range of areas of AI Deep learning is not by itself sufficient though It’s unlikely even to handle all the vision and natural language problems but it has made a huge difference to what AI systems can currently doWhat challenges still need to beovercome before we see truly“natural” conversations between computers and humans One major challenge is getting good data There’s a lot more data around today than a few years ago but it’s not always the right sort of data If you want to learn about natural language you need to study real dialogue Twitter is not good data for that because it isn’t like real are trying to achieve Another relates to improvements in the way team members exchange information There seem to have been huge leaps in the development and application of AI technologies in recent years What is driving that progress Many of the most important ideas in AI like neural networks or text mining have been around since the 1960s but thecomputers of the time weren’t powerful enough so they just didn’t work Now thanks to video games and the development of powerful

difficult to get the right sort of data and to do it ethically because you need permission from the participants if you are going to study their conversations It will also be difficult to ensure you collect data from a full range of people You can’t just collect data from college sophomore students as they have traditionally done in psychology research nor just from today’s heavy users of social media nor just of English speakers Even withina single country there will be differentdialects and different cultural influences on conversational structuresWill developments in other areas of computer science like quantum computers have a significant impact in the field of AIThere’s no question that when they get quantum computing to work it will allow us to solve problems we can’t solve now But I can’t tell you what those problems will be The extent to which these technologies will help to increase reasoning capabilities is dependent on us understanding better how to get systems to reason at the higher cognitive level involved in human intelligent behaviorWhere do you think AI technologies will have the biggest impact in future and what are the implications forpeople’s jobs and roles I don’t want to do any crystal ball gazing but there is a lot of interest in using AI to improve education and healthcare delivery I also think the autonomous vehicle arena is going to see a lot of change With regard to health care and education I think there’s a huge ethical question for society at large We could build those systems to complement and work with physicians and teachers or we could try to save money by having them replace people It would be a terriblemistake to replace people There are great things that AI systems will be able to do in terms of processing large amounts of data but that doesn’t give you the same view into a patient What patients need is a physician who knows them in depth The same is true ineducation Rather than trying to replace teachers you can design systems to support them If you have 30 or 40 students working on computer systems theteacher can’t track them all but a computer can It can detect when students are not paying attention or are running into difficulty and it can alert the teacher to who needs help and why That’s exactly the kind of system we’ve been buildingThe widespread use of AI will raise important risks and ethical issues How can they be addressedAll human activities carry risks andmanaging those risks requires acombination of design policies and regulations I believe we have to deal with ethics at the moment of design That means we need to teach our students to consider ethical issues in design and how to address those issues Andindustry needs to make ethical issues and ethical design as important as the design of efficient algorithms We need industry to form partnerships – as it is now doing – to share best practices and we need to have technology people social scientists and cognitive scientists as well as lawyers in the room when regulations are writtenWhat potential areas of applicationfor AI technologies do you personally find most excitingI believe there is a tremendous opportunity for AI to help people in lowresource communities around the world to have better lives and also for the environment if we make that a priority There are some people working on AI for such settingstoday in a variety of applications including education systems and healthcare delivery systems I think that’s very exciting It may not make a lot of money for anybody right away but the longterm economic benefits from raising the level of health and education in lowresource communities and improving the environment will be much more important“It would be a terrible mistake to replacepeople”Barbara J GroszProfessor

remain undiscovered But it can do even more than thatBASF’s brandnew supercomputerQURIOSITY can perform 175 quadrillion calculations per second – an achievement that really heats up the hardware “The waste heat from one rack alone could heat two houses” says Stephan Schenk PhD Team Leader High Performance ComputingDatabases at BASF half with a smile and half with respect In all the 18 giant racks have the capacity of around 50000 laptops – which would make QURIOSITY’s cables overheat and its components melt if it were not for its sophisticated airwater cooling system It is connected to the BASF Verbund an intelligent production system connecting all BASF plants at a site which already plays a important role in cooling production facilities “Electricity and cooling are the big challenges that still impose limits on supercomputers” Schenk says The new super brain can provide about 10 times the computing power that was possible at BASF until now It is by far the biggest computer in the chemical industryIts planning too went quickly “InSeptember 2016 our requirements for oursupercomputer were clear and we launched the tender soon after that” Schenk says At that time the experts at HewlettPackard Enterprise HPE were already in the process of developing a new generation of supercomputers In December 2016 BASF and HPE signed a contract under which BASF would receive the first newgenerationsupercomputer In the subsequent months HPE in Texas got down to the practical work of creating BASF’s supercomputer The right hardware and software architecture was sketched out on flip charts standing meters high and the first models were made out of foam and cardboard until finally the components of QURIOSITY were assembled in the computer racks of a Houston factory hall as big as a soccer field After successful performance measurements the supercomputer was then delivered to Ludwigshafen Germany in July 2017Chemistry out of a supercomputerResearchers and developers in particular were waiting eagerly for QURIOSITY – with its concentrated computing power and fed with the right information the supercomputer can help to evaluate complicated models In the future

getting it to production scale – to happen more quickly in the future The problem here is that chemicals behave completely differently in the laboratory and in a production reactor BASF researchers were able to represent these changes by means of complex computer simulations “This saved us needing to build a pilot plant” Schenk saysAt the same time QURIOSITY can also be used as an optimizer in production Thanks to this digital computing genius data from everyday operations and those relating to price and business cycle trends can be pulled together enabling facilities to be more efficiently run Maintenance dates can be predicted before damage occurs and raw materials and energy can be made available with even greater precision “The supercomputer is a tool that can provide valuable support in many parts of BASF from research and development to production and logistics and new digital business models” says Martin Brudermüller PhD Vice Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors and Chief Technology Officer at BASF Schenk adds that “if it enables me to improve a product by 1 percent this can in the best case result in earnings of tens of millions per year” This means that the energy costs when the brain of the computer heats up again are a good investmentFocusBASF06what happens when variables in achemical compound change and then to test the new compounds in laboratory experiments Expectations are high It is intended that by simulating chemical processes the supercomputer will reveal completely new possibilities that were previously considered impossible theoretically or on a laboratory scale Already today there are indications of the potential of such huge computing power when computer simulations support laboratory experiments For example BASF was looking for an existing active agent in a soluble form for a crop protection product Instead of performing thousands of experiments they fed a large number of possible structures into a computer which derived suggestions for experiments from that information The best hundred found their way to the laboratory This was not merely faster but also more successful “In BASF – Focus\f26 – Creating

But maybe we should actually be afraid of completely different thingsOn September 11 2001 256 passengers lost their lives in the airplanes used in theterrorist attacks in the United States During the following year an alarming aftereffect was observed In 2002 statistics showed a drastic increase of 1600 in the number of road traffic fatalities – about 4 percent more “Out of fear many people avoided airplanes and used their cars instead The increase in traffic resulted in more road accidents And consequently more deaths” explains Professor Gerd Gigerenzer Director of the Harding Center for Risk Literacy Berlin Germany Shocked by the attacks people now perceived air travel as very dangerous “Paradoxically we have hardly any fear of dying in an accident but we are more afraid of perishing along with many others – as in an aircraft or a terrorist attack” Gigerenzer says We disregard the fact that we have already put the – statistically – most dangerous part of the journey behind us when we leave our car in the parking lot at the airport Their feeling tells people they are more in control behind the steering wheel of their own car than in a plane flown by a pilot “And a controllable risk seems less dangerous than an uncontrollable one” says Paul Slovic a professor of psychology at the University of Oregon USA and one of the leading experts in risk perception However in the first years following the attacks not a single deadly accident happened during commercial flights in the United StatesA sense of reality looks differentEpidemics terrorist attacks plane crashes

with figures and statistics” Gigerenzer says People today are afraid of dangers that either do not exist at all for them or are very unlikely – for dangers are one thing but the probability that they will actually happen is something else A lion is certainly dangerous but if it is captive in a zoo the danger to humans is relatively low “Our lives are more lowrisk than ever and dangers often seem more threatening to us than they actually are” says Professor Ortwin Renn Scientific Director at the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies IASS in Potsdam Germany who has worked extensively on the topic of risk perception Paradoxically this fear is intensified by the fact that we are so well off and everything is actually fine “That is because this naturally also means we have a lot to lose” Renn says In saturated societies such as those of the Western industrialized nations he explains people have correspondingly more fear than in less developed societies where individuals expect to make personal progress by taking risks Irrationality is internationalThere are many reasons for our incorrect assessments Our perception of risk is influenced by feelings not by our intellect Thus our assessment of probabilities is different from the statistical reality “Most risk analysis in daily life is handled quickly and automatically by feelings arising from what is known as the ‘experiential’ mode of thinking” Slovic says The fact that we repeatedly also experience improbable things and that the media report on them confirms us in our belief that improbable things may not be so improbable after all That is an error in reasoning The thing that we fear most is probably the thing that we are most unlikely to experienceSocial and cultural factors also play a big part in what frightens us Nevertheless irrationality is international It is universally true that the risk of rare and spectacular things such as tornados air crashes or terrorist attacks is overrated while more probable causes of death are overlooked Risk expert Slovic has identified two more factors If someone takes a risk by choice he’ll perceive it as less dangerous than a risk forced upon him The greatest dangers however are met with indifference – high blood pressure obesity alcohol smoking Also a highfat diet is wrongly considered more lowrisk than genetically modified food Topic – Risk“A

culture and society says the Japanese risk researcher and founding director of Litera Japan Co Mariko NishizawaCulture of fearMariko Nishizawa PhD Risk researcher and founding director Tokyo JapanRisk perception always depends on the context If people are constantly hearing news items about the spread of viruses they are more likely to believe that they too could get infected By contrast if they are used to certain risks they will regard those as not so dangerous For example the Japanese have lived with earthquakes for generations and so are much more relaxed about the risk of earthquakes than say Germans whohave scarcely any knowledgeof earthquakes from their own experienceFood qualityBy contrast the Japanese are very sensitive about the quality of their food They do not like it to contain any artificial additives or added colors Americans however tolerate artificial additives that enable food to be kept longer Hormone treatments for animals are also taboo in Japan as they are in many European countries In the United States though they are regularly given to animals Therefore it is evident that what people reject as risky varies by culture New technologies This is also made clear in attitudes to technological innovations In Germany risks are investigated at an early stage People are aware that there is no such thing as a 100 percent riskfree technology – and they are therefore often hesitant and cautious about taking new unfamiliar paths This may be a small reflection of the old German angst Americans by contrast are open to technological progress In Japan too highend technology is overwhelmingly valued and is already being used on a huge scale – from highspeed trains that run on time to robots at hotel reception desksRisk – TopicThe risk of tornados in the United States is especially high from March through JulyThis tornado ragedthrough CampoColorado in May 2010“What people know or think they know often does not frighten them” Renn says Similarly many people are more anxious about the risks of new technologies than the risks of familiar ones However fear of the unknown or technophobia is not a good adviser for responsibly managed risk means innovation progress and consequently improved living conditions Giving up these effects entails a high risk for society Harboring reservations about the unknown therefore means high indirect costsThe fact that we assess dangerswrongly is also related to modern technologyModern methods of analysis can identify the smallest impurities Scientists are now literally able to find needles in haystacks –

excessive perspiration This is because in greatly diluted form – a tiny bottle contains only onebillionth of a gram of the poison – and correctly used the benefit is greater than the possible risks or side effects Flood of information altersperception of riskAlongside the greater precision ofanalysis there is also a glut of mediageneratedinformation about dangers that is changing perceptions News constantly rains down on us from all corners of the globe This news actually affects individuals only rarely but it has a huge impact on our perception of risk Especially in relation to the discovery of chemicals in food one shock wave seems to follow another Although critical reporting is fundamentally important it often turns out when viewed calmly to have been about something far from the level at which a danger would exist By contrast one of the biggest risk factors in relation to food lies in an area that attracts little public attention consumers’ hygiene habits as the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment is repeatedly pointing out Across Germany the Campylobacter bacterium is now the most common cause of intestinal infection with more than 70000 documented cases a year and the true figure could be much higher However hardly anybody knows about it and this pathogenic bacterium has so far rarely featured in the media HoweverCampylobacter is found on nearly every chicken and is therefore also present on Topic – Riskother pieces of meat that are roasted or grilled Often all that it takes to cause an infection is for a raw piece of chicken to be placed on the grill and for the same hand then to touch a cooked sausageRisk as a political issueThe more unsettled the public are the harder it becomes for policymakers to maintain a rational course This isdemonstratedrepeatedly in relation to controversialtopics such as food safety nuclear power or green genetic engineering Risk awareness is a good weapon against such a nervousatmosphere “Only if we learn how weourselves process risk and draw appropriate realistic conclusions from information about risk will we have the means to assess risk better in the future and to handle it more appropriately” Renn says There is no way of avoiding this the risk researcher stresses “Risk is part of our lives”“We have to learnhow we process risk in order to handle it more appropriately in the future”Professor Ortwin Renn Scientific Director at the Institute for Advanced SustainabilityStudies Potsdam Germany1 mountainclimbing trip540 kilometersautomobile driving1 marathon1 anesthetic in a

studies linking diesel emissions to respiratory illness and cancer calls have been made to ban diesel vehicles in several major European cities and public confidence has been shaken Can diesel be turned around or is it the end of the road for this fuel We ask diesel scientist Professor Thomas Koch of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Julia Poliscanova clean vehicles expert at the European lobby group TransportEnvironment for their viewsCreating Chemistry Paris Stuttgart and Madrid are among the cities that face the challenge of banning diesel vehicles by 2025 Are they doing the right thingProfessor Thomas Koch No it’s not right to ban them Modern diesel cars have a negligible impact on urban emissions Regarding investment cost they may not be the right solution for every driving profile However in the latest generation the nitrogen oxide NOX emissions issue has been solved Under typical driving conditions they emit far less than the new stricter European limits permit and even less than many gasoline engines It’s true there are older cars that are less clean The question is now how to optimize these which is a different issue from banning diesel technologyJulia Poliscanova I agree that in future clean diesel can exist but the reality is that the current generation of diesel cars still on the market today is not clean Their realtime driving emissions exceed the new limits These cars will probably be on the road for another 15 years while the vehicles with the newest technology will not be certified for sale until 2019 at the earliest So it’s solved in the lab but it’s certainly not solved in real life Cities simply don’t have other options to clean up their airThe two alternatives to diesel most often mentioned are gasoline and batterypowered electric vehicles Are these better choicesKoch All solutions must contribute to a world of mobility of course without any impact on people’s health If you make many short journeys withincities a gasoline gasoline hybrid or battery Above An electric car powers up at a charging station Right Particulate matter is measured at Neckator in Stuttgart Germany Far right Low emission zones are being introduced in many citiesTwo perspectives – Dieselpowered electric vehicle is a very good solution As soon as you drive more than 12000 kilometers a year diesel becomes more attractive Provided the technology is completely neutral in terms of health I’m open to every technology I do not see a real difference anymore except where the electricity is generated from a fuel source with high greenhouse gas emissions such as coalPoliscanova The new generation gasoline vehicles will have particle filters but they still have some emissions By comparison electric vehicles have zero tailpipe emissions so it’s zero versus low emissions In terms of the environmental impact of the electricity a study by a Belgian university VUB looked into the lifecycle analysis of different electric vehicles on different electricity mixes and compared Photo gettyimages Daniel Naupolddpa\fPhoto shutterstock ASCSthem with the life cycle of diesel vehicles It found that only when electric vehicles are run on electricity generated entirely from coalfired plants are they slightly worse than diesel As we are adding more renewable energy all the time to the energy mix the electric advantage will continue to increaseSo do you believe an electriconlyfuture is on the way Poliscanova If policy makers want it it would absolutely be possible to have an electriconly auto world by midcentury In the medium term gasoline engines are a perfect combination to first of all go to hybrid gasoline then to plugin hybrid and finally to fully electric The range issue has largely been solved – the fully electric vehicles coming on to the market this year or next all have a range of over 200 kilometers In three years it will be over 300 The cost is decreasing and we will have electric vehicles that are pretty much fully competitive with conventional ones by the early 2020s I think there is still one issue – that of charging infrastructure However we have time to solve this I also think there’s a whole change in the way we see mobility It’s a threeway revolution electric autonomous and shared All three will be the future of mobility In that respect the electric engine is a perfect contributionKoch There is no doubt that autonomous driving and shared mobility have great potential for the future but that’s a separate issue from whether a vehicleis powered by electricity or by a combustion engineI also agree that it’s one solution to have battery powered electric cars but why push this technology alone There are some real disadvantages the weight of the cars the range fossilbased electricity generation and the cost of infrastructure which will be passed on to the consumer through taxes and fees Also imagine if we were not able to separate theenergy for transportation which today is basically liquid fuels from the energy for other purposes – think how vulnerable the whole economy would be if there were a breakdown I believe we will need dieselgasoline and hybrid engines for quite a long timeFor which uses will diesel continue to bean important part of the fuel mixKoch For longhaul trucks in particular diesel engines will continue to give the best environmental balance but also for medium and longer distance cars For a standard sedan the diesel is simply the better drive train with 10 to 20 percent fewer CO2 emissions in comparison with gasoline and less than a gasoline hybrid Taking into consideration the complete production of diesel from the well to the tank as well as from the tank to the wheel the diesel engine has a lower CO2 impact than gasoline So we need it that’s the message in briefPoliscanova It is true per kilometer a diesel engine is more efficient than gasoline But in the last few years we have seen gasoline engines “Diesel technology will be lifted to the next level in combination with hybridization and will be further improved”Professor Thomas KochDiesel – Two perspectivesCreating Chemistry – 39\f40 – Creating ChemistryTwo perspectives – Dieselcatch up and the difference in CO2 emissions today is very small especially for smaller cars Diesel by contrast is driving the wrong kind of consumerbehavior by encouraging people especially in Europe to buy bigger cars thus nullifying the advantage With trucks diesel will continue to play a role but long term there are other solutions We might not have all trucks electric because of battery weight but other options include ehighways where trucks are powered by overhead electric cablesHow would you compare maintenance and running costs between these drive trains Poliscanova According to the EuropeanConsumer Association electric vehicles are becoming thebetter solution in terms of total cost of ownership One recently updated study by Element Energy found that they will catch up with conventional cars in the next few years If you look at lease contracts which is already a big part of the market electric vehicles have reached parity with diesel vehicles By the early 2020s they will also reach parity with private vehicle owners From the perspective of consumers I think the one issue they still have with electric vehicles is that there are not enough models offered on the market If there were consumers would buy more electric cars todayKoch The total cost of ownership of electric vehicles is still higher than diesel For many operating conditions they are not competitive Also without gasoline and diesel’s contribution to tax income which in Germany is about €36 billion the battery electric vehicle would come under pressure However as I said I see electric as another interesting approach which makes sense for certain uses I would be happy having competitive battery powered vehicles But diesel will remain an attractiveconsumerfriendly option for a very long timeGovernment incentives and taxes make a difference to consumer choices What would happen if the playing field were levelKoch If the subsidies for electric cars werereduced this technology would definitely comeunder pressure I agree that electric cars are an interesting approach and for urban mobility pure electric vehicles do make sense to a certain extent What governments should do is set environmental standards and let the market offer vehicles that meet those standards rather than defining which technology we use Diesel technology will be lifted to the next level in combination with hybridization and will be further improved It will continue to be an attractive alternative for consumers for years independent of the level of taxes as well as being the most environmentally friendly way to movePoliscanova In Europe the lower taxes on diesel mean that around 50 percent of new sales are diesel cars But if you look at markets where there is no diesel subsidy sales are below 5 percent In the US they are less than 1 percent and in China less than 2 percent The biggest change we would see in Europe if we were not subsidizing any fuel is that demand for diesel would drop and we wouldproduce more smaller compact city vehicles We don’t need more than that in European citiesWhat are your final thoughtsPoliscanova The main minus of diesel is the complexity required to clean it up Yes we can add another technological solution another exhaust aftertreatment another pipe another catalyst another sensor but as such diesel is just verycomplicated and that makes it expensive Incomparison electric vehicles are simple clean and low maintenance Also we should consider the competitiveness issue 70 percent of global light duty diesel vehicles are sold in Europe The sharein the US and China is less than 1 percent You cannot ignore the fact that other regions in the world aren’t going down the diesel path Mypersonal belief is that the future is electricKoch I wonder why opponents of diesel technology argue by ignoring so many facts But we do notdisagree on one point What we are doing today is not environmentally friendly – we import fossil fuel and burn it here in Europe What we need to do instead is develop completely synthetic fuels hydrocarbons that are 100 percent environmentally friendly We’ve started working on this and it is the right way forward to build on this important technology For now affordable diesel provides the freedom to drive quickly anywhere at any time in every weather – at minus 15 degrees Celsius or plus 40 degrees Celsius One of mankind’s dreams“In the last few yearsgasoline engines have caught up with diesel The difference in CO2 emissions today is very small” Julia Poliscanova\fPhoto BASF Jonas RatermannIf we take current estimates about global warming seriously we need diesel It has a clear advantage over gasoline in terms of CO2 emissions and fuel efficiency What is more the latest diesel engines are the cleanest ever taking 99 percent of NOX and particulate matter out of the exhaust Nor is this just under laboratory conditions The new Real Driving Emissions test mandated by the European Union in 2017 measures the pollutants emitted from all new certified cars under real driving conditions proving that new diesel vehicles run cleanly not just in the testing laboratory but also on the road Fortunately these stringent standards are already achievable thanks in part to the contributions of BASF chemists and engineers Our catalyst technologies and aftertreatments help new vehicles pass the toughest environmental tests Clean diesel as part of the mobility mix I strongly believe that in the future batteryelectrical vehicles will gain a significant market share and going to play an important role in the future mobility mix For the foreseeable future range battery weight and power output will continue to restrict the value of pure electric vehicles to short commutes and light commercial uses Expense will also be an inhibiting factor for some time To match total cost of ownership with aninternal combustion engine the battery cost would have to fall considerably Here again BASF makes important contributions toward these goals The company produces and develops advanced cathode materials for lithiumion batteries Frank MönkebergFrank Mönkeberg PhD is Head of Application Engineering for Europe at BASF He is based in Hanover GermanyThe future of mobility may one day beelectric but we believe diesel still has animportant role to play That is why our chemistry supports the development of a range of clean technologies from the latest diesel engines to batterypowered electric vehiclesand is exploring nextgeneration battery material concepts including lithiumsulfur technologyAs electric vehicles are still a technology in the early stages we need clean diesel as part of the mobility mix particularly if we are to meet the Paris Climate Accord goal of restricting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius It’s fine to think about an electric future but if we want a livable one we need a range of clean technologies And instead of hoping for an electrical mobility revolution it makes more sense to use all options in place Synthetic fuels CO2 neutral for example could also play an important role in achieving global CO2 targetsThe future of mobility has to be sustainable How we meet that goal must be the subject of continuing factbaseddiscussion Meanwhile our technologies will continue to make a variety of cleanoptions possible so the consumer can choose the one that best suits their needs99of NOX and particulate matter is taken out of the exhaust by the latest diesel

achieve this companies have to ask the right questions of their suppliers For that they need to fully understand their supply chain and must take action Suppliers who continue to breach commitments

BASF’s proprietary molecular biology tools and technologiesA living factoryWith the development of modern biotechnology new possibilities have opened up for producing useful enzymes at anindustrial scale using genetically modified microorganisms The filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger has the natural capacity toproduce BASF laboratory technicians isolateindividual strains of micro­organismsunder sterile conditionsIn the research lab for whitebiotechnology at BASF themicroorganisms are grown on agarose plates Enzymes from BASF enableinnovative product solutions for various customer industriesto produce acrylamide a product used in wastewater treatmentpapermakingmineral processing and enhanced oilrecovery By switching from copper catalysis to a biocatalytic production method less energy is needed and fewer byproducts are generatedEnzymes offer an efficient way to make things we need with minimum environmental impact They are also excellent recyclers Without them our waste would still be lying around Created by cells as required when no longer needed they break down into their molecular components leaving no residueThe hunt for new enzymesEnzymes are found in microorganisms all over the planet from deep sea thermal vents to the top of the Himalayas Scientists scour the planet for new enzyme diversity enzymes such as phytase glucanase and xylanase It normally produces thesebiocatalysts in small quantities Whenmodified the fungus can speed upproduction and increase its yield of enzymes Aspergillus niger is now used to manufacture BASF’s Natuphos® and Natugrain® TS optimized versions of phytase glucanase and xylanase These feed enzymes help pigs and poultry to better utilize phosphorus and other important nutrientsNature’s giftUnderstanding the principle function of an enzyme what makes it work and how this relates to its structure makes it possible to modify it at the molecular level to improve its performance – like tuning a motor to get the optimum performance In the past this work was carried out blindly Today 3D images of enzymes help work out what to tweakto get the desired outcome The more thatis understood about enzymes the better they can be used to make industrial processes more sustainable\f54 – Creating ChemistryPhoto Tom SaaterFresh produceand a fresh start Inspiration With 85 million hectares of uncultivated arable landwhy is Nigeria a net importer of food Nigerian entrepreneurAngel Adelaja has set out to tackle this problem using advanced technology to grow fresh produceAccording to the World Bank Nigeriaimported around 34 billion worth ofvegetable products in 2014 and exportedonly 760 million Yet it has vast areas of uncultivated arable land With a population of 186 million growing at 26 percent a year improving food security means developing innovative approaches to agricultureThis is the mission behind Fresh Direct a startup founded by Nigerianentrepreneur Angel Adelaja Her aim is to helpNigeria reduce its reliance on food imports byintroducing advanced technologies toimprove crop yields Fresh Direct uses a hydroponic system in adapted shipping containers to grow produce Theproduction of vegetables from just one sixmetercontainer is equivalent to that from around 6000 square meters When thecontainers are stacked on top of each other the output per square meter of farm rises dramatically Plants are grown under lights and without soil Instead they are suspended innutrientrich water and dripfed water This method means growing takes place 247Growing fastFresh Direct says it can achieve 10 times the yield of traditional farming using one fifteenth of the land and a fraction of the water requirements The company now has four containers at two sites in Abuja the Nigerian capital Six more containers are planned as well as a warehouse in Lagos In any given month each container produces around 3000 heads of vegetables and the InspirationAngel Adelaja at one of Fresh Direct’s microfarms in Abuja Nigeria\fCreating Chemistry – 55Photo Tom SaaterInspirationcompany founded in 2015 is now earning enough money to reinvest and expand“It’s not a silver bullet” says Adelaja “The amount we produce is a drop in the bucket What’s important is the synergy betweentraditional rural farms providing the bulk of the produce and our container farmsfocusing on crops that are mostly imported”To avoid competing with local farmers Fresh Direct focuses on vegetables that are not grown locally and have to be imported such as butterhead lettuce and blue dwarf kale There’s enough land around the containers to farm fish chicken and goats too “We have two major customers that purchase most of what we produce and then we have a little extra for our other customers” says Adelaja “We’re scaling to meet demand Our market is where there are people interested in healthy eating If you look at Lagos Port Harcourt Abuja Kaduna Kano – those are the places” Growing the produce close to the city means Fresh Direct avoids the problems of poor transport infrastructure and high fuel costs But it’s not just about output it’s about The produce is grown at sites close to customers so that it is fresh on deliveryYoung employees at Fresh Direct from left Salome Salime Umoru Solomon Tyopev Mercy Nanret Da’arSalome Salime Umoru 24 started working on the farm in December 2016 “I didn’t know anything aboutagriculture or hydroponic farming before I was working in a salon as a cleaner Now I earn more every month and am more optimistic about my future” she saysSolomon Tyopev 25 looks after the livestock – chicken catfish and tilapia – and does deliveries He’s been working at the farm for a year “I used to work in a bar Before coming to Fresh Direct I had no idea about farming Now I feel more secure” he says Mercy Nanret Da’ar 23 has also been working at Fresh Direct for a year “Before I was unemployed The job interested me because you can get a lot ofexperience in a business like this” she says“Agriculture as a business is very important There should be more farms like this” “I feel I’m impacting people’s lives I’mcreating jobs andopportunities”Angel

have gained through working for the companypeople too Fresh Direct’s employees are mainly young local people who benefit from training and higherthanaverage salaries Adelaja acts as a guarantor to help them obtain bank accounts and access the wider financial system Before setting up Fresh DirectAdelaja worked with the national coordinator ofthe Nigerian president’s poverty eradicationprogram Youth unemployment in Nigeria stands at 78 percent The government has set up initiatives such as micro credit and conditional cash transfer but Adelaja felt more could be done to raise people out of poverty so she looked for ways to directly stimulate the local economy56 – Creating ChemistryInspirationWater is carefully dripfed on to each plantAngelAdelaja holds a freshly harvested organic lettuceAgriculture makes up 21 percent ofNigeria’s economy and is the largest source of employment It therefore seemed the ideal sector to target But Adelaja quickly realized that traditional smallholder farming techniques could not be efficiently scaled up and poor rural infrastructure was also a problem After initial research she decided that hydroponics was the way forward The idea of using shipping containers came to her while visiting a construction company She and her partner then set about building a prototype in her yardMaking a difference“If you can’t push wellmeaning policies into action and impact people’s lives then there’s no point With Fresh Direct I feel I’m impacting people’s lives I’m creating jobs and opportunities” she says “Most of the young people who work for Fresh Direct had no previous agricultural experience “Agriculture as a businessis important There shouldbe more farms like this”Salome Salime UmoruFarmer at Fresh Direct Abuja NigeriaThey were working as house helpers or janitors We want to empower everyone that joins us”Fresh Direct’s success has caught the attention of development agencies In 2017 Adelaja won the World Economic Forum’s award for “breakthrough female technology entrepreneur”“We’ve had a lot of interest and that’s been helpful People have contacted us from Senegal Ethiopia and other places because they want to replicate what we are doing Now we’re thinking about how to create a franchise model” she says The plan is to expand in Nigeria then test the market in places such as Dakar Senegal and Accra Ghana “Longer term I see Fresh Direct across West Africa and even East Africa as well” says Adelaja “I want to see a system where people are employers and entrepreneurs I want success stories – I want

beliefs however become ingrained Here are three examples of things that wealways thought we knew but in fact didn’t Photo gettyimagesCalmer chameleonsShowing their mood People who change their appearance or character to fit in have long been described as“chameleonlike” after the lizards’supposed ability to changecolor and blend into their surroundings Butchameleons are already very well camouflaged – and they are fast runners too Their color changes actually relate to mood temperature light and communication rather than to avoidance of predators A darker color for example can signify anger or absorb heat while a lighter shade could helpattract a mate Scientists used to believe the changes were dictated by pigment in the chameleons’ chromatophore cells but a 2015 report revealed that it is more complicated Relaxing or tensing the skin causes nanocrystals in a further layer of iridescent chromatophores called iridophores to act as prisms and reflect different wavelengths of light so creating the impressive palette of colors A matter of tasteSignals from the tongue It used to be a staple of the school science lesson – the “tongue map” diagram showing which parts of the tongue respond exclusively to salty sweet and bitter tastes It was always however an oversimplification The receptors are actually distributed all over The theory behind it originates from a paper written in 1901 describing slight differences in taste thresholds around the edges of the tongue It was almost threequarters of a century before the “map” was challenged Research at Columbia University New York USA in 2017 has further identified special molecules that help the tongue send signals to the brain to identify different tastes The taste receptor cells are able to express molecular signals that attract the correct taste neurons and so relay information to our brainsNot eggsactly right Healthy after all For decades people were warned against eating too many eggs because of dietary cholesterol in the yolks But in 2015 the US government’s Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee quietly amended its recommendations stating that the evidence showed “no appreciable relationship” between dietary cholesterol from for example eggs and blood cholesterol levels Although the revision proved controversial according to current science it is better to cut down on saturated fat in foods such as butter meat and fullfat dairy products For most people an egg a day is just fine\f58 – Creating ChemistryPhoto Jörg BlockChemistry around usThey improve the taste with sweet coatings serve as disintegrants enabling tablets to release their active ingredients quickly or act to improve their appearance Pharmaceutical excipients have no healing effect themselves but active ingredients could not properly unleash their own healing power without themFor example they package the active ingredient to make it easier to swallow or able to resist aggressive gastric juices and liver enzymes The requirements for excipients are becoming more and more demanding whereas the molecules of active ingredients often used to have simplestructures and were highly soluble they have now changed and are less soluble This makes it hard for the human body toabsorb them and limits themedicine’s effectivenessThis is a problem in more than 70 percent of all newlydeveloped active ingredients To improve their effectiveness BASF isdeveloping excipients such asSoluplus® a solubilizer thatenables the body to absorb drugs that do not dissolve easily Inall BASF offers more

finding new active agents They make water and energy supplies more efficient and are important helpers in predicting epidemics and earthquakes or in diagnosing illnesses For example oncologists in Japan were groping in the dark in the case of a 60yearold woman until they enlisted IBM’s Watson This supercomputer required just 10 minutes to compare the data of the sick woman’s diagnosis against millions of cancer studies to find an extremely rare type of leukemia The doctors adjusted their therapy and the woman was treated successfully with the help of “Dr Watson”Recordbreaking

human development such as the discovery of fire Competition in the market is correspondingly fierce China and the United States in particular are engaged in a race among highperformance computers The world’s first supercomputer came on to the market in 1964 in the United States in the form of the CDC 6600 The Americans dominated the scene for many years but recently computers from China have made their way to the top At 93 petaflops – that‘s 93000000000000000 calculations per second – the Sunway TaihuLight is the fastest supercomputer by far as of November 2017 “With its help complex climate models for example can be calculated nearly a hundred times faster than by a computer capable of one petaflop which would need one year for the task This adds a whole new dimension to the fight against climate change” Sterling says The Sunway is followed by the Tianhe2 which still has almost twice as much computing power as the Piz Daint from Switzerland which comes third The fastest US

processes one to one” says the German philosopher of science and expert in artificial intelligence AI Professor Klaus Mainzer Out of the many possible combinations of these building blocks they help to single out those that offer the prospect of surprising discoveries and new products The supercomputer is capable of learning and it performs an initial selection so that only the most promising substances find their way into the laboratory Accordingly BASF has since fall 2017 relied on just such a powerful digital helper for developing virtual experiments and answering complex questions It shortens the time taken to obtain usable results from several months to a few days see pages 24–25“The challenging problems in the field of chemistry could become drivers for supercomputing” Sterling believes In his view they could contribute to investigating the critical boundaries of technology – and how to overcome them The bottlenecks between processors and memory pose increasing problems to the industry These become more serious as the masses of data which have to be shifted around in simulations for example grow larger “This bottleneck in traditional von Neumann computerarchitecture needs to be eliminated” Sterling says A new way of thinking is required to bring together computing and memory operations in a smart way Another technology has already assimilated the elementary logic by which chemical processes work the quantum computer which could open up new horizons of knowledge The next dimension of super brains – thinking in several states at once – is in the starting blocks\f14 – Creating ChemistryPhoto dwave systemsSuch processors are intended to make quantum computers the most powerful type availableQuantum computersA shiny silver cylinder holds the treasure qubits frozen by a helium pump to minus 273 degrees Celsius These are the building blocks that enable quantum computers to work because unlike the bits in a classical computer qubits can store and process two states simultaneously This new computer logic is intended to make them much faster than any supercomputer and their search for new products applications or patterns more efficient The disadvantage is that qubits are extremely volatile They function in a stable faultfree manner only if there are no external influences To ensure this they have to be not merely frozen but also shielded from the outside world in a vacuumFragile super brainsEfforts to crack this problem are still in the initial stages To date researchers have developed fully programmable fivequbit computers and more fragile 10 to 20qubit test systems For example in May 2017 IBM presented a processor with 17 qubits which is intended to form the foundation of the first commercially available quantum computer “We’re progressing faster and faster” says IBM researcher AnthonyAnnunziata PhD from the United States Now he notes the IBM system is stable enough to perform computing operations over a fairly longperiod But Annunziata warns that the technology is still at a very early stage “Quantum computers are more or less at the same stage as classicalcomputers were in the 1940s but they are developing even more rapidly than classical computers did back then” he saysIt is only when we reach around 30 to 50qubits that a quantum computer would be superior to any conventional supercomputer in solving a specific problem in the view of experts such as Professor Raymond Laflamme Director of the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo in Canada “But if we extrapolate the trend of the last 15 years 100 qubits are conceivable within the next 10 years” says the pioneer in quantum computing The Massachusetts Institute of Technology predicts that a fundamental breakthrough for quantum computers could well be made within four to five years 02“Quantum computers are more or less atthe same stage asclassical computers were in the 1940s”Anthony Annunziata PhDIBM researcher USAFocus – Age of the super brainsPrecision work by hand onthe DWave quantum computer which developers at NASA and Google for example are usingWhether it is IBM Google Microsoft or Intel none of the big tech companies is afraid of the high cost involved in developing a powerful quantum computer – to say nothing of secret services like the US NSA which are probably working “under the radar” on powerful quantum systems to crack encrypted communicationsQuantum computers bring impetusThis is because Moore’s Law according to which the power of computer chips will double every one to two years is now getting close to its technological limits Experts believe that a breakthrough in quantum computers could provide a fresh impetus According to Laflamme six to seven teams worldwide are currently engaged in research to achieve this goal and billions arebeing spent in the process For example theEuropean Commission is planning to invest €1 billion in driving progress in quantum technology over the next nine years Also China made headlines in August 2017 with the news that a satellite had shared a quantum key with a ground station for the firstCreating Chemistry – 15Photo

simultaneouslyWhat a qubit is A qubit is an information unit in quantum mechanics Whereas the bits of classical computers work in a state of 1 or 0 a qubit can simultaneously assume both values –or an infinite number of inter mediate states If it werepossible to bundle hundreds of these building blocks together in a quantumcomputer that computer would be able in a moment to store and process

bottom ofthe quantumcomputer provideitsenormouscomputing powertime – a milestone on the road to virtually unhackable encryption through quantum technologyHowever “for the foreseeable future quantum computers won’t surpass or even substitute supercomputers across the board” Annunziata says “They will act as a supplement for the solution of very special problems” They are ideally suited to represent dynamics in molecules and thus to show for example how one electron interacts with another and with the nucleus “If the number of electronic states increases the number of possible interactions increases exponentially Asconventional computers can’t represent that properly they try with approximations” he says A quantum computer meanwhile is already using quantum mechanics the kind of mechanisms that are also at work in molecular interactionsBenefits for researchSeveral sectors can benefit from the greater precision of modeling such as materials sciences and the chemical or pharmaceutical industries Laflamme says Researchers can use the disadvantage of quantum particles – their sensitivity – to their advantage here for example in prospecting for natural resources or diagnosing illnesses For instance qubits are already being deployed as supersensitive sensors that can precisely detect individual atoms of defective proteins that might turn cancerous To do this they focus very closely on the vibrations of one specific atomCurrently though the main priority is to increase the number of people who want to understand and use quantum computers Annunziata says This is why IBM made its quantum computer accessible to the public about a year ago Since then 50000 users have accessed the QuantumExperience platform Through the open sourceapproach it is possible to learn from and with the community Annunziata says According to media reports Google’s parent company Alphabet has recently followed suit with its quantum computer and is planning to open it to academics and developers This may result in the emergence of a kind of ecosystem in which the discipline of “quantum computing” is able to flourishNow and thenLearn more about the historyof computers

relationship between humans and algorithms1Algorithms are only humantoo The deceptive semblance of objectivityData are being analyzed by software in more and more areas of life Such algorithms are gaining in power as a result However they are as subjective and selective as their programming by their human “creators” Algorithms incorporate the conscious or unconscious prejudices and life experiences of their programmers Loans are refused or made hard to obtain because the software places the borrower in a problematicneighborhood even though the person is perfectly solvent Seemingly objective software to predict crime “predictive policing” can serve to reinforce existing discrimination If it leads police to perform a particularly high number of checks in socially deprived areas they will possibly record more crime there This will then be more stronglyweighted in digitized forecasts2The world is a story to be told – not a thing to be countedTrue value creation results from a combination of data analysis and human expertise As early as 2008 Chris Anderson announced the “end of theory” “The data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete” wrote the editor of Wired magazine He believed that thanks to big data algorithms could find patterns that research and science would never discover with their own methods “With enough data the numbers speak for themselves” Anderson said However some ten years after Anderson’s article that euphoria has been replaced by a more sober assessment This is attributable to failures by data collectors like Google whose Flu Trends program in 20122013 saw a flu epidemic on the march that never actually materialized In complex situations correlations cannot take the place of causality or assumptions the place of evidence Human expertise is required here3Computers propose humans dispose We have to maintain control over technologyArtificial intelligence AI systems are already developing independently Using mathematical logic they are learning from their mistakes and making their own decisions It is barely possible for humans to grasp exactly how the neural networks of AI reach their conclusions in every case This is an area with an urgent need for improvement says informatics professor Alan Bundy from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland Meanwhile politicians and consumerrights activists are demanding recognizedstandards for AI algorithms as they grow smarter They also want their workings to be subject to independent examination – especially when Human and machine03Focus – Age of the super brains 157trillion is the

values cannot be replicatedMachines are making rapid progress in learning thanks to AI and machine­ learning algorithms Researchers regard super­ intelligence – machines superior to humans in many or all areas – as possible within a few decades This requires a rational look at the limits and scope of new technologies In specific areas artificial intelligence can use solid data as the basis to make objectively better decisions than humans who often act intuitively However in complex decisions that go to the heart of the way that humans live together such as the fight against pov­erty there is no right or a wrong answer Behind such decisions there are humans making choices according to their respective experience values and goals This essence of a humane democratic society cannot be delegated to smart machinesPro Artificial intelligence AI systems are already capable of doing things that we achieve through learning experiences and intuition They do this just with great computing power and sophisticatedmathematics It is without doubt a significant innovation and we should make use of it Artificial intelligence can beat any poker expert without emo­tion or consciousness even though the game is regarded as a byword for intuition Moreover poker is merely a prototype for situations in which humans have to make decisions with incomplete infor­mation Sooner or later these algorithms will also be used in decision­making situations in business and politics For example they could support us but not take our place in complex contracts Thanks to big data it is now possible to identify the opinions of specific groups very precisely Techno­logically through AI something like a government by “perfect populism” is imaginable Some authors even believe democracy is endangered by highly intelligent algorithms This debate could be dismissed as science fiction I take it seri­ously Therefore we must take care to ensure that AI systems remain our servantsContra We are still extremely far from seeing intelligent machines take over the world If a Google computer is better than a human at mastering a very complex game there will be awestruck comments “Oh these machines are smarter than us” But a program of that sort can actually only do that one thing Even AI systems used in autonomous driving still have a very limited focus The artificial intelligence won’t be saying to itself “Um the way I’m acting right now might not be particularly safe” Humans however can take a step back and look at things from a broader perspective The real danger isn’t technol­ogy becoming too smart but comes from overrating stupid machines from entrusting them with tasks that overstrain them For instance when doc­tors rely too heavily on AI in their diagnoses But these are threats to individual

They say that if you ask six researchers todefine AI you will get seven differentdefinitions so I’ll give you mine Artificial intelligence is both a field of study and a set of computational methods As a field of study the focus is on what I would call a computational understanding ofintelligent behavior By a computational understanding I mean determining the kinds of cognitive processes and representations that are needed to produce intelligent behavior thendetermining how to realize those in a computer system The set ofcomputational methods are then the algorithms even the mathematics but also the computational structures that you need to actually operationalize that understandingCreating computer systems that can communicate freely with people is akey challenge in artificial intelligence How has your work on naturallanguage processing aided in the pursuit ofthis goal When I started there were a lot of people working on syntactic processingmeaning the structure of sentences and semantic processing which is how meaning is built Everybody knew in some sense that context dialogue and pragmatics mattered but they had no idea how to handle these factorscomputationallySo one of the first things I did werewhat were later known as “Wizard of Oz” experiments I put two people in two different rooms communicating withteletype machines I told one of themthat they were talking with a computer and I asked them to complete a taskThe transcripts generated in thoseexperiments revealed that these kinds of “taskoriented dialogues” have a structure that the structure parallels the task and that the way in which we talk is affected by that structure Once I’ddeveloped a computational model of these taskoriented dialogues the next question was how you generalize from those to other types of conversation That led me with colleagues to the development of intentional models and to speechact theory which other people in AI have picked up onWhat happens when there are multiple agents communicating with each otherIn a dialogue you can’t assume that every participant understands everything about the other participants’ knowledge or intentions When you have multiple participants working together you have to model not only their individual plans but also the way participants interact and the way their plans are interwoven One thread of my work has been thedevelopment of those models Another has been to use the theoretical models as inspiration for design or as constraints on what parts of systems you have to buildAn example is a project I’m working Artificial intelligencewill support peoplenot replace themInterview Barbara Grosz Higgins Professor of Natural Sciences at Harvard University has worked since the 1970s at the highest level of

Stanford Medical school involving children with complex conditions Those children may see upwards of 12 or 15 care providers who may have little detailed knowledge about each other’s work Today’s electronic health record systems do nothing to help these providers coordinate care delivery We are using our multiagent systems theory of collaboration as an analytic lens to see what is going on when careproviders and patients or in this case parents try to work together to see where the missing pieces are and understand what systems we can design that would help them work more effectively as a team One of those pieces is something that ensures all participants can see what the goals are so they know what they more layers That’s made an enormous difference in a range of areas of AI Deep learning is not by itself sufficient though It’s unlikely even to handle all the vision and natural language problems but it has made a huge difference to what AI systems can currently doWhat challenges still need to beovercome before we see truly“natural” conversations between computers and humans One major challenge is getting good data There’s a lot more data around today than a few years ago but it’s not always the right sort of data If you want to learn about natural language you need to study real dialogue Twitter is not good data for that because it isn’t like real are trying to achieve Another relates to improvements in the way team members exchange information There seem to have been huge leaps in the development and application of AI technologies in recent years What is driving that progress Many of the most important ideas in AI like neural networks or text mining have been around since the 1960s but thecomputers of the time weren’t powerful enough so they just didn’t work Now thanks to video games and the development of powerful graphical processing units there is a lot more computing power out there That’s enabled the machinelearning community to develop what’s known as deep learning which involves neural networks with manyCreating Chemistry – 23Photo Alex TrebusInterview – Focusdialogue nor are the sort of rudimentary interactions we currently have with Siri and similar personal assistant systems It will be difficult to get the right sort of data and to do it ethically because you need permission from the participants if you are going to study their conversations It will also be difficult to ensure you collect data from a full range of people You can’t just collect data from college sophomore students as they have traditionally done in psychology research nor just from today’s heavy users of social media nor just of English speakers Even withina single country there will be differentdialects and different cultural influences on conversational structuresWill developments in other areas of computer science like quantum computers have a significant impact in the field of AIThere’s no question that when they get quantum computing to work it will allow us to solve problems we can’t solve now But I can’t tell you what those problems will be The extent to which these technologies will help to increase reasoning capabilities is dependent on us understanding better how to get systems to reason at the higher cognitive level involved in human intelligent behaviorWhere do you think AI technologies will have the biggest impact in future and what are the implications forpeople’s jobs and roles I don’t want to do any crystal ball gazing but there is a lot of interest in using AI to improve education and healthcare delivery I also think the autonomous vehicle arena is going to see a lot of change With regard to health care and education I think there’s a huge ethical question for society at large We could build those systems to complement and work with physicians and teachers or we could try to save money by having them replace people It would be a terriblemistake to replace people There are great things that AI systems will be able to do in terms of processing large amounts of data but that doesn’t give you the same view into a patient What patients need is a physician who knows them in depth The same is true ineducation Rather than trying to replace teachers you can design systems to support them If you have 30 or 40 students working on computer systems theteacher can’t track them all but a computer can It can detect when students are not paying attention or are running into difficulty and it can alert the teacher to who needs help and why That’s exactly the kind of system we’ve been buildingThe widespread use of AI will raise important risks and ethical issues How can they be addressedAll human activities carry risks andmanaging those risks requires acombination of design policies and regulations I believe we have to deal with ethics at the moment of design That means we need to teach our students to consider ethical issues in design and how to address those issues Andindustry needs to make ethical issues and ethical design as important as the design of efficient algorithms We need industry to form partnerships – as it is now doing – to share best practices and we need to have technology people social scientists and cognitive scientists as well as lawyers in the room when regulations are writtenWhat potential areas of applicationfor AI technologies do you personally find most excitingI believe there is a tremendous opportunity for AI to help people in lowresource communities around the world to have better lives and also for the environment if we make that a priority There are some people working on AI for such settingstoday in a variety of applications including education systems and healthcare delivery systems I think that’s very exciting It may not make a lot of money for anybody right away but the longterm economic benefits from raising the level of health and education in lowresource communities and improving

QURIOSITY supercomputer can perform each second equivalent to the power of around 50000 laptopsSupercomputer under themicroscopeBASF QURIOSITY is the most powerful computer in the chemical industry worldwide The new BASF supercomputer is intended to find new chemical compounds and products that would otherwise remain undiscovered But it can do even more than thatBASF’s brandnew supercomputerQURIOSITY can perform 175 quadrillion calculations per second – an achievement that really heats up the hardware “The waste heat from one rack alone could heat two houses” says Stephan Schenk PhD Team Leader High Performance ComputingDatabases at BASF half with a smile and half with respect In all the 18 giant racks have the capacity of around 50000 laptops – which would make QURIOSITY’s cables overheat and its components melt if it were not for its sophisticated airwater cooling system It is connected to the BASF Verbund an intelligent production system connecting all BASF plants at a site which already plays a important role in cooling production facilities “Electricity and cooling are the big challenges that still impose limits on supercomputers” Schenk says The new super brain can provide about 10 times the computing power that was possible at BASF until now It is by far the biggest computer in the chemical industryIts planning too went quickly “InSeptember 2016 our requirements for oursupercomputer were clear and we launched the tender soon after that” Schenk says At that time the experts at HewlettPackard Enterprise HPE were already in the process of developing a new generation of supercomputers In December 2016 BASF and HPE signed a contract under which BASF would receive the first newgenerationsupercomputer In the subsequent months HPE in Texas got down to the practical work of creating BASF’s supercomputer The right hardware and software architecture was sketched out on flip charts standing meters high and the first models were made out of foam and cardboard until finally the components of QURIOSITY were assembled in the computer racks of a Houston factory hall as big as a soccer field After successful performance measurements the supercomputer was then delivered to Ludwigshafen Germany in July 2017Chemistry out of a supercomputerResearchers and developers in particular were waiting eagerly for QURIOSITY – with its concentrated computing power and fed with the right information the supercomputer can help to evaluate complicated models In the future QURIOSITY is intended to help with tasks like calculating newmolecular

Schenk says The supercomputer is also intended to help a scaleup – the step from making something in the laboratory to getting it to production scale – to happen more quickly in the future The problem here is that chemicals behave completely differently in the laboratory and in a production reactor BASF researchers were able to represent these changes by means of complex computer simulations “This saved us needing to build a pilot plant” Schenk saysAt the same time QURIOSITY can also be used as an optimizer in production Thanks to this digital computing genius data from everyday operations and those relating to price and business cycle trends can be pulled together enabling facilities to be more efficiently run Maintenance dates can be predicted before damage occurs and raw materials and energy can be made available with even greater precision “The supercomputer is a tool that can provide valuable support in many parts of BASF from research and development to production and logistics and new digital business models” says Martin Brudermüller PhD Vice Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors and Chief Technology Officer at BASF Schenk adds that “if it enables me to improve a product by 1 percent this can in the best case result in earnings of tens of millions per year” This means that the energy costs when the brain of the computer heats up again are a good investmentFocusBASF06what happens when variables in achemical compound change and then to test the new compounds in laboratory experiments Expectations are high It is intended that by simulating chemical processes the supercomputer will reveal completely new possibilities that were previously considered impossible theoretically or on a laboratory scale Already today there are indications of the potential of such huge computing power when computer simulations support laboratory experiments For example BASF was looking for an existing active agent in a soluble form for a crop protection product Instead of performing thousands of experiments they fed a large number of possible structures into a computer which derived suggestions for experiments from that information The best hundred

kind of fearRisk We are surrounded by dangers Terrorism air crashes contaminated food – these all cause us fear But maybe we should actually be afraid of completely different thingsOn September 11 2001 256 passengers lost their lives in the airplanes used in theterrorist attacks in the United States During the following year an alarming aftereffect was observed In 2002 statistics showed a drastic increase of 1600 in the number of road traffic fatalities – about 4 percent more “Out of fear many people avoided airplanes and used their cars instead The increase in traffic resulted in more road accidents And consequently more deaths” explains Professor Gerd Gigerenzer Director of the Harding Center for Risk Literacy Berlin Germany Shocked by the attacks people now perceived air travel as very dangerous “Paradoxically we have hardly any fear of dying in an accident but we are more afraid of perishing along with many others – as in an aircraft or a terrorist attack” Gigerenzer says We disregard the fact that we have already put the – statistically – most dangerous part of the journey behind us when we leave our car in the parking lot at the airport Their feeling tells people they are more in control behind the steering wheel of their own car than in a plane flown by a pilot “And a controllable risk seems less dangerous than an uncontrollable one” says Paul Slovic a professor of psychology at the University of Oregon USA and one of the leading experts in risk perception However in the first years following the attacks not a single deadly accident happened during commercial flights in the United StatesA sense of reality looks differentEpidemics terrorist attacks plane crashes – people nowadays often rate riskshigher than they should They suffer from an emotional imbalance “It’s difficult for people to “Subjective fear strongly differs from factual reality which can be substantiated with figures andstatistics”Professor Gerd GigerenzerDirector of the

gettyimagesassess risks correctly Their subjective fear strongly differs from factual reality which can be substantiated with figures and statistics” Gigerenzer says People today are afraid of dangers that either do not exist at all for them or are very unlikely – for dangers are one thing but the probability that they will actually happen is something else A lion is certainly dangerous but if it is captive in a zoo the danger to humans is relatively low “Our lives are more lowrisk than ever and dangers often seem more threatening to us than they actually are” says Professor Ortwin Renn Scientific Director at the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies IASS in Potsdam Germany who has worked extensively on the topic of risk perception Paradoxically this fear is intensified by the fact that we are so well off and everything is actually fine “That is because this naturally also means we have a lot to lose” Renn says In saturated societies such as those of the Western industrialized nations he explains people have correspondingly more fear than in less developed societies where individuals expect to make personal progress by taking risks Irrationality is internationalThere are many reasons for our incorrect assessments Our perception of risk is influenced by feelings not by our intellect Thus our assessment of probabilities is different from the statistical reality “Most risk analysis in daily life is handled quickly and automatically by feelings arising from what is known as the ‘experiential’ mode of thinking” Slovic says The fact that we repeatedly also experience improbable things and that the media report on them confirms us in our belief that improbable things may not be so improbable after all That is an error in reasoning The thing that we fear most is probably the thing that we are most unlikely to experienceSocial and cultural factors also play a big part in what frightens us Nevertheless irrationality is international It is universally true that the risk of rare and spectacular things such as tornados air crashes or terrorist attacks is overrated while more probable causes of death are overlooked Risk expert Slovic has identified two more factors If someone takes a risk by choice he’ll perceive it as less dangerous than a risk forced upon him The greatest dangers however are met with indifference – high blood pressure obesity alcohol smoking Also a highfat diet is wrongly considered more lowrisk than genetically modified food Topic – Risk“A controllable risk seems less dangerous than an uncontrollable

and founding director of Litera Japan Co Mariko NishizawaCulture of fearMariko Nishizawa PhD Risk researcher and founding director Tokyo JapanRisk perception always depends on the context If people are constantly hearing news items about the spread of viruses they are more likely to believe that they too could get infected By contrast if they are used to certain risks they will regard those as not so dangerous For example the Japanese have lived with earthquakes for generations and so are much more relaxed about the risk of earthquakes than say Germans whohave scarcely any knowledgeof earthquakes from their own experienceFood qualityBy contrast the Japanese are very sensitive about the quality of their food They do not like it to contain any artificial additives or added colors Americans however tolerate artificial additives that enable food to be kept longer Hormone treatments for animals are also taboo in Japan as they are in many European countries In the United States though they are regularly given to animals Therefore it is evident that what people reject as risky varies by culture New technologies This is also made clear in attitudes to technological innovations In Germany risks are investigated at an early stage People are aware that there is no such thing as a 100 percent riskfree technology – and they are therefore often hesitant and cautious about taking new unfamiliar paths This may be a small reflection of the old German angst Americans by contrast are open to technological progress In Japan too highend technology is overwhelmingly valued and is already being used on a huge scale – from highspeed trains that run on time to robots at hotel reception desksRisk – TopicThe risk of tornados in the United States is especially high from March through JulyThis tornado ragedthrough CampoColorado in May 2010“What people know or think they know often does not frighten them” Renn says Similarly many people are more anxious about the risks of new technologies than the risks of familiar ones However fear of the unknown or technophobia is not a good adviser for responsibly managed risk means innovation progress and consequently improved living conditions Giving up these effects entails a high risk for society Harboring reservations about the unknown therefore means high indirect costsThe fact that we assess dangerswrongly is also related to modern technologyModern methods of analysis can identify the smallest impurities Scientists are now literally able to find needles in haystacks – one molecule among a septillion of others

examplebotulinum toxin better known as botox is the most poisonous substance thatnatureproduces One tablespoon would be enough to poison the whole of Europe the GermanNeurological Society has calculated as a mental exercise Nevertheless manypeople voluntarily have this neurotoxin injected under their skin or use it medicinally for cramps spasms or excessive perspiration This is because in greatly diluted form – a tiny bottle contains only onebillionth of a gram of the poison – and correctly used the benefit is greater than the possible risks or side effects Flood of information altersperception of riskAlongside the greater precision ofanalysis there is also a glut of mediageneratedinformation about dangers that is changing perceptions News constantly rains down on us from all corners of the globe This news actually affects individuals only rarely but it has a huge impact on our perception of risk Especially in relation to the discovery of chemicals in food one shock wave seems to follow another Although critical reporting is fundamentally important it often turns out when viewed calmly to have been about something far from the level at which a danger would exist By contrast one of the biggest risk factors in relation to food lies in an area that attracts little public attention consumers’ hygiene habits as the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment is repeatedly pointing out Across Germany the Campylobacter bacterium is now the most common cause of intestinal infection with more than 70000 documented cases a year and the true figure could be much higher However hardly anybody knows about it and this pathogenic bacterium has so far rarely featured in the media HoweverCampylobacter is found on nearly every chicken and is therefore also present on Topic – Riskother pieces of meat that are roasted or grilled Often all that it takes to cause an infection is for a raw piece of chicken to be placed on the grill and for the same hand then to touch a cooked sausageRisk as a political issueThe more unsettled the public are the harder it becomes for policymakers to maintain a rational course This isdemonstratedrepeatedly in relation to controversialtopics such as food safety nuclear power or green genetic engineering Risk awareness is a good weapon against such a nervousatmosphere “Only if we learn how weourselves process risk and draw appropriate realistic conclusions from information about risk will we have the means to assess risk better in the future and to handle it more appropriately” Renn says There is no way of avoiding this the risk researcher stresses “Risk is part of our lives”“We have to learnhow we process risk in order to handle it more appropriately in the future”Professor Ortwin Renn Scientific Director at

studies linking diesel emissions to respiratory illness and cancer calls have been made to ban diesel vehicles in several major European cities and public confidence has been shaken Can diesel be turned around or is it the end of the road for this fuel We ask diesel scientist Professor Thomas Koch of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Julia Poliscanova clean vehicles expert at the European lobby group TransportEnvironment for their viewsCreating Chemistry Paris Stuttgart and Madrid are among the cities that face the challenge of banning diesel vehicles by 2025 Are they doing the right thingProfessor Thomas Koch No it’s not right to ban them Modern diesel cars have a negligible impact on urban emissions Regarding investment cost they may not be the right solution for every driving profile However in the latest generation the nitrogen oxide NOX emissions issue has been solved Under typical driving conditions they emit far less than the new stricter European limits permit and even less than many gasoline engines It’s true there are older cars that are less clean The question is now how to optimize these which is a different issue from banning diesel technologyJulia Poliscanova I agree that in future clean diesel can exist but the reality is that the current generation of diesel cars still on the market today is not clean Their realtime driving emissions exceed the new limits These cars will probably be on the road for another 15 years while the vehicles with the newest technology will not be certified for sale until 2019 at the earliest So it’s solved in the lab but it’s certainly not solved in real life Cities simply don’t have other options to clean up their airThe two alternatives to diesel most often mentioned are gasoline and batterypowered

technology is completely neutral in terms of health I’m open to every technology I do not see a real difference anymore except where the electricity is generated from a fuel source with high greenhouse gas emissions such as coalPoliscanova The new generation gasoline vehicles will have particle filters but they still have some emissions By comparison electric vehicles have zero tailpipe emissions so it’s zero versus low emissions In terms of the environmental impact of the electricity a study by a Belgian university VUB looked into the lifecycle analysis of different electric vehicles on different electricity mixes and compared Photo gettyimages Daniel Naupolddpa\fPhoto shutterstock ASCSthem with the life cycle of diesel vehicles It found that only when electric vehicles are run on electricity generated entirely from coalfired plants are they slightly worse than diesel As we are adding more renewable energy all the time to the energy mix the electric advantage will continue to increaseSo do you believe an electriconlyfuture is on the way Poliscanova If policy makers want it it would absolutely be possible to have an electriconly auto world by midcentury In the medium term gasoline engines are a perfect combination to first of all go to hybrid gasoline then to plugin hybrid and finally to fully electric The range issue has largely been solved – the fully electric vehicles coming on to the market this year or next all have a range of over 200 kilometers In three years it will be over 300 The cost is decreasing and we will have electric vehicles that are pretty much fully competitive with conventional ones by the early 2020s I think there is still one issue – that of charging infrastructure However we have time to solve this I also think there’s a whole change in the way we see mobility It’s a threeway revolution electric autonomous and shared All three will be the future of mobility In that respect the electric engine is a perfect contributionKoch There is no doubt that autonomous driving and shared mobility have great potential for the future but that’s a separate issue from whether a vehicleis powered by electricity or by a combustion engineI also agree that it’s one solution to have battery powered electric cars but why push this technology alone There are some real disadvantages the weight of the cars the range fossilbased electricity generation and the cost of infrastructure which will be passed on to the consumer through taxes and fees Also imagine if we were not able to separate theenergy for transportation which today is basically liquid fuels from the energy for other purposes – think how vulnerable the whole economy would be if there were a breakdown I believe we will need dieselgasoline and hybrid engines for quite a long timeFor which uses will diesel continue to bean important part of the fuel mixKoch For longhaul trucks in particular diesel engines will continue to give the best environmental balance but also for medium and longer distance cars For a standard sedan the diesel is simply the better drive train with 10 to 20 percent fewer CO2 emissions in comparison with gasoline and less than a gasoline hybrid Taking into consideration the complete production of diesel from the well to the tank as well as from the tank to the wheel the diesel engine has a lower CO2 impact than gasoline So we need it that’s the message in briefPoliscanova It is true per kilometer a diesel engine is more efficient than gasoline But in the last few years we have seen gasoline engines “Diesel technology will be lifted to the next level in combination with hybridization and will be further improved”Professor Thomas KochDiesel – Two perspectivesCreating Chemistry – 39\f40 – Creating ChemistryTwo perspectives – Dieselcatch up and the difference in CO2 emissions today is very small especially for smaller cars Diesel by contrast is driving the wrong kind of consumerbehavior by encouraging people especially in Europe to buy bigger cars thus nullifying the advantage With trucks diesel will continue to play a role but long term there are other solutions We might not have all trucks electric because of battery weight but other options include ehighways where trucks are powered by overhead electric cablesHow would you compare maintenance and running costs between these drive trains Poliscanova According to the EuropeanConsumer Association electric vehicles are becoming thebetter solution in terms of total cost of ownership One recently updated study by Element Energy found that they will catch up with conventional cars in the next few years If you look at lease contracts which is already a big part of the market electric vehicles have reached parity with diesel vehicles By the early 2020s they will also reach parity with private vehicle owners From the perspective of consumers I think the one issue they still have with electric vehicles is that there are not enough models offered on the market If there were consumers would buy more electric cars todayKoch The total cost of ownership of electric vehicles is still higher than diesel For many operating conditions they are not competitive Also without gasoline and diesel’s contribution to tax income which in Germany is about €36 billion the battery electric vehicle would come under pressure However as I said I see electric as another interesting approach which makes sense for certain uses I would be happy having competitive battery powered vehicles But diesel will remain an attractiveconsumerfriendly option for a very long timeGovernment incentives and taxes make a difference to consumer choices What would happen if the playing field were levelKoch If the subsidies for electric cars werereduced this technology would definitely comeunder pressure I agree that electric cars are an interesting approach and for urban mobility pure electric vehicles do make sense to a certain extent What governments should do is set environmental standards and let the market offer vehicles that meet those standards rather than defining which technology we use Diesel technology will be lifted to the next level in combination with hybridization and will be further improved It will continue to be an attractive alternative for consumers for years independent of the level of taxes as well as being the most environmentally friendly way to movePoliscanova In Europe the lower taxes on diesel mean that around 50 percent of new sales are diesel cars But if you look at markets where there is no diesel subsidy sales are below 5 percent In the US they are less than 1 percent and in China less than 2 percent The biggest change we would see in Europe if we were not subsidizing any fuel is that demand for diesel would drop and we wouldproduce more smaller compact city vehicles We don’t need more than that in European citiesWhat are your final thoughtsPoliscanova The main minus of diesel is the complexity required to clean it up Yes we can add another technological solution another exhaust aftertreatment another pipe another catalyst another sensor but as such diesel is just verycomplicated and that makes it expensive Incomparison electric vehicles are simple clean and low maintenance Also we should consider the competitiveness issue 70 percent of global light duty diesel vehicles are sold in Europe The sharein the US and China is less than 1 percent You cannot ignore the fact that other regions in the world aren’t going down the diesel path Mypersonal belief is that the future is electricKoch I wonder why opponents of diesel technology argue by ignoring so many facts But we do notdisagree on one point What we are doing today is not environmentally friendly – we import fossil fuel and burn it here in Europe What we need to do instead is develop completely synthetic fuels hydrocarbons that are 100 percent environmentally friendly We’ve started working on this and it is the right way forward to build on this important technology For now affordable diesel provides the freedom to drive quickly anywhere at any time in every weather – at minus 15 degrees Celsius or plus 40 degrees Celsius One of mankind’s dreams“In the last few yearsgasoline engines have caught up with diesel The difference in CO2 emissions today is very small” Julia Poliscanova\fPhoto BASF Jonas RatermannIf we take current estimates about global warming seriously we need diesel It has a clear advantage over gasoline in terms of CO2 emissions and fuel efficiency What is more the latest diesel engines are the cleanest ever taking 99 percent of NOX and particulate matter out of the exhaust Nor is this just under laboratory conditions The new Real Driving Emissions test mandated by the European Union in 2017 measures the pollutants emitted from all new certified cars under real driving conditions proving that new diesel vehicles run cleanly not just in the testing laboratory but also on the road Fortunately these stringent standards are already achievable thanks in part to the contributions of BASF chemists and engineers Our catalyst technologies and aftertreatments help new vehicles pass the toughest environmental tests Clean diesel as part of the mobility mix I strongly believe that in the future batteryelectrical vehicles will gain a significant market share and going to play an important role in the future mobility mix For the foreseeable future range battery weight and power output will continue to restrict the value of pure electric vehicles to short commutes and light commercial uses Expense will also be an inhibiting factor for some time To match total cost of ownership with aninternal combustion engine the battery cost would have to fall considerably Here again BASF makes important contributions toward these goals The company produces and develops advanced cathode materials for lithiumion batteries Frank MönkebergFrank Mönkeberg PhD is Head of Application Engineering for Europe at BASF He is based in Hanover GermanyThe future of mobility may one day beelectric but we believe diesel still has animportant role to play That is why our chemistry supports the development of a range of clean technologies from the latest diesel engines to batterypowered electric vehiclesand is exploring nextgeneration battery material concepts including lithiumsulfur technologyAs electric vehicles are still a technology in the early stages we need clean diesel as part of the mobility mix particularly if we are to meet the Paris Climate Accord goal of restricting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius It’s fine to think about an electric future but if we want a livable one we need a range of clean technologies And instead of hoping for an electrical mobility revolution it makes more sense to use all options in place Synthetic fuels CO2 neutral for example could also play an important role in achieving global CO2 targetsThe future of mobility has to be sustainable How we meet that goal must be the subject of continuing factbaseddiscussion Meanwhile our technologies will continue to make a variety of cleanoptions possible so the consumer can choose the one that best suits their needs99of NOX and particulate matter is taken out of the exhaust by the latest diesel

the industry works to improve sustainability we ask what progress has been made and what needs to happen next to protect the environment and people“I have witnessed the struggle of the elder generations to stand up against companies who wanted to take over the forest and convert it into oil palm estates Now I preserve the forest for the sake of future generations” Arifin is a forest keeper in West Kalimantan Indonesia Deforestation displaced communities destruction of the natural habitats of rare species – the impact of palm oil production has caused widespread public concern in recent years and even sparked calls to boycott palmoil products Yet palm oil remains the most widely consumed vegetable oil in the world found in half of all packaged products In thedecade from 2003

against palm oil or the palm oil industry per se Yet while most big companies have adopted sustainability policies unsustainable palm oil is still making its way into theirsupply chains through small and medium sized firms involved in forest destruction and human rights abuses These firms need to either compensate for their damages in a timely manner or be entirely cut off from the market To achieve this companies have to ask the right questions of their suppliers For that they need to fully understand their supply chain and must take action Suppliers who continue to breach commitments

Nigeriaimported around 34 billion worth ofvegetable products in 2014 and exportedonly 760 million Yet it has vast areas of uncultivated arable land With a population of 186 million growing at 26 percent a year improving food security means developing innovative approaches to agricultureThis is the mission behind Fresh Direct a startup founded by Nigerianentrepreneur Angel Adelaja Her aim is to helpNigeria reduce its reliance on food imports byintroducing advanced technologies toimprove crop yields Fresh Direct uses a hydroponic system in adapted shipping containers to grow produce Theproduction of vegetables from just one sixmetercontainer is equivalent to that from around 6000 square meters When thecontainers are stacked on top of each other the output per square meter of farm rises dramatically Plants are grown under lights and without soil Instead they are suspended innutrientrich water and dripfed water This method means growing takes place 247Growing fastFresh Direct says it can achieve 10 times the yield of traditional farming using one fifteenth of the land and a fraction of the water requirements The company now has four containers at two sites in Abuja the Nigerian capital Six more containers are planned as well as a warehouse in Lagos In any given month each container produces around 3000 heads of vegetables and the InspirationAngel Adelaja at one of Fresh Direct’s microfarms in Abuja Nigeria\fCreating Chemistry – 55Photo Tom SaaterInspirationcompany founded in 2015 is now earning enough money to reinvest and expand“It’s not a silver bullet” says Adelaja “The amount we produce is a drop in the bucket What’s important is the synergy betweentraditional rural farms providing the bulk of the produce and our container farmsfocusing on crops that are mostly imported”To avoid competing with local farmers Fresh Direct focuses on vegetables that are not grown locally and have to be imported such as butterhead lettuce and blue dwarf kale There’s enough land around the containers to farm fish chicken and goats too “We have two major customers that purchase most of what we produce and then we have a little extra for our other customers” says Adelaja “We’re scaling to meet demand Our market is where there are people interested in healthy eating If you look at Lagos Port Harcourt Abuja Kaduna Kano – those are the places” Growing the produce close to the city means Fresh Direct avoids the problems of poor transport infrastructure and high fuel costs But it’s not just about output it’s about The produce is grown at sites close to customers so that it is fresh on deliveryYoung employees at Fresh Direct from left Salome Salime Umoru Solomon Tyopev Mercy Nanret Da’arSalome Salime Umoru 24 started working on the farm in December 2016 “I didn’t know anything aboutagriculture or hydroponic farming before I was working in a salon as a cleaner Now I earn more every month and am more optimistic about my future” she saysSolomon Tyopev 25 looks after the livestock – chicken catfish and tilapia – and does deliveries He’s been working at the farm for a year “I used to work in a bar Before coming to Fresh Direct I had no idea about farming Now I feel more secure” he says Mercy Nanret Da’ar 23 has also been working at Fresh Direct for a year “Before I was unemployed The job interested me because you can get a lot ofexperience in a business like this” she says“Agriculture as a business is very important There should be more farms like this” “I feel I’m impacting people’s lives I’mcreating jobs andopportunities”Angel

have gained through working for the companypeople too Fresh Direct’s employees are mainly young local people who benefit from training and higherthanaverage salaries Adelaja acts as a guarantor to help them obtain bank accounts and access the wider financial system Before setting up Fresh DirectAdelaja worked with the national coordinator ofthe Nigerian president’s poverty eradicationprogram Youth unemployment in Nigeria stands at 78 percent The government has set up initiatives such as micro credit and conditional cash transfer but Adelaja felt more could be done to raise people out of poverty so she looked for ways to directly stimulate the local economy56 – Creating ChemistryInspirationWater is carefully dripfed on to each plantAngelAdelaja holds a freshly harvested organic lettuceAgriculture makes up 21 percent ofNigeria’s economy and is the largest source of employment It therefore seemed the ideal sector to target But Adelaja quickly realized that traditional smallholder farming techniques could not be efficiently scaled up and poor rural infrastructure was also a problem After initial research she decided that hydroponics was the way forward The idea of using shipping containers came to her while visiting a construction company She and her partner then set about building a prototype in her yardMaking a difference“If you can’t push wellmeaning policies into action and impact people’s lives then there’s no point With Fresh Direct I feel I’m impacting people’s lives I’m creating jobs and opportunities” she says “Most of the young people who work for Fresh Direct had no previous agricultural experience “Agriculture as a businessis important There shouldbe more farms like this”Salome Salime UmoruFarmer at Fresh Direct Abuja NigeriaThey were working as house helpers or janitors We want to empower everyone that joins us”Fresh Direct’s success has caught the attention of development agencies In 2017 Adelaja won the World Economic Forum’s award for “breakthrough female technology entrepreneur”“We’ve had a lot of interest and that’s been helpful People have contacted us from Senegal Ethiopia and other places because they want to replicate what we are doing Now we’re thinking about how to create a franchise model” she says The plan is to expand in Nigeria then test the market in places such as Dakar Senegal and Accra Ghana “Longer term I see Fresh Direct across West Africa and even East Africa as well” says Adelaja “I want to see a system where people are employers and entrepreneurs I want success stories – I want thisto be what government can’t do”BASF Derelict buildingsto urban farm in Detroit USA The Michigan Urban FarmingInitiative in Detroit aims to use urban agriculture to promote education sustainability

beliefs however become ingrained Here are three examples of things that wealways thought we knew but in fact didn’t Photo gettyimagesCalmer chameleonsShowing their mood People who change their appearance or character to fit in have long been described as“chameleonlike” after the lizards’supposed ability to changecolor and blend into their surroundings Butchameleons are already very well camouflaged – and they are fast runners too Their color changes actually relate to mood temperature light and communication rather than to avoidance of predators A darker color for example can signify anger or absorb heat while a lighter shade could helpattract a mate Scientists used to believe the changes were dictated by pigment in the chameleons’ chromatophore cells but a 2015 report revealed that it is more complicated Relaxing or tensing the skin causes nanocrystals in a further layer of iridescent chromatophores called iridophores to act as prisms and reflect different wavelengths of light so creating the impressive palette of colors A matter of tasteSignals from the tongue It used to be a staple of the school science lesson – the “tongue map” diagram showing which parts of the tongue respond exclusively to salty sweet and bitter tastes It was always however an oversimplification The receptors are actually distributed all over The theory behind it originates from a paper written in 1901 describing slight differences in taste thresholds around the edges of the tongue It was almost threequarters of a century before the “map” was challenged Research at Columbia University New York USA in 2017 has further identified special molecules that help the tongue send signals to the brain to identify different tastes The taste receptor cells are able to express molecular signals that attract the correct taste neurons and so relay information to our brainsNot eggsactly right Healthy after all For decades people were warned against eating too many eggs because of dietary cholesterol in the yolks But in 2015 the US government’s Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee quietly amended its recommendations stating that the evidence showed “no appreciable relationship” between dietary cholesterol from for example eggs and blood cholesterol levels Although the revision proved controversial according to current science it is better to cut down on saturated fat in foods such as butter meat and fullfat dairy products For most people an egg a day is just fine\f58 – Creating ChemistryPhoto Jörg BlockChemistry around usThey improve the taste with sweet coatings serve as disintegrants enabling tablets to release their active ingredients quickly or act to improve their appearance Pharmaceutical excipients have no healing effect themselves but active ingredients could not properly unleash their own healing power without themFor example they package the active ingredient to make it easier to swallow or able to resist aggressive gastric juices and liver enzymes The requirements for excipients are becoming more and more demanding whereas the molecules of active ingredients often used to have simplestructures and were highly soluble they have now changed and are less soluble This makes it hard for the human body toabsorb them and limits themedicine’s effectivenessThis is a problem in more than 70 percent of all newlydeveloped active ingredients To improve their effectiveness BASF isdeveloping excipients such asSoluplus® a solubilizer thatenables the body to absorb drugs that do not dissolve easily Inall BASF offers more

especially, in, europe, to, buy, bigger, cars, thus, nullifying, the, advantage, with, trucks, diesel, will, continue, to, play, a, role, but, long, term, there, are, other, solutions, we, might, not,

from, the, perspective, of, consumers, i, think, the, one, issue, they, still, have, with, electric, vehicles, is, that, there, are, not, enough, models, offered, on, the, market, if, there, were, consumers, would, buy, more, electric, cars, todaykoch, the, total, cost, of, ownership, of, electric, vehicles, is, still, higher, than, diesel, for, many, operating, conditions, they, are, not, competitive, also, without, gasoline, and, diesel’s, contribution, to, tax, income, which, in, germany, is, about, €36, billion, the, battery, electric, vehicle, would, come, under, pressure, however, as, i, said, i, see, electric, as, another, interesting, approach, which, makes, sense, for, certain, uses, i, would, be, happy, having, competitive, battery, powered, vehicles, but, diesel, will,

for, urban, mobility, pure, electric, vehicles, do, make, sense, to, a, certain, extent, what, governments, should, do, is, set, environmental, standards, and, let, the, market, offer, vehicles, that, meet, those, standards, rather, than, defining, which, technology, we, use, diesel, technology, will, be, lifted, to, the, next, level, in, combination, with, hybridization, and, will, be, further,

subsidy, sales, are, below, 5, percent, in, the, us, they, are, less, than, 1, percent, and, in, china, less, than, 2, percent, the, biggest, change, we, would, see, in, europe, if, we, were, not,

another, pipe, another, catalyst, another, sensor, but, as, such, diesel, is, just, verycomplicated, and, that, makes, it, expensive, incomparison, electric, vehicles, are, simple, clean, and, low,

opponents, of, diesel, technology, argue, by, ignoring, so, many, facts, but, we, do, notdisagree, on, one, point, what, we, are, doing, today, is, not, environmentally, friendly, –, we, import,
